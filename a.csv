An evaluation of knowledge base systems for large OWL datasets|http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/b102467.pdf#page=295|2004|270|21|17955804086974855466|None|http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17955804086974855466&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en|http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17955804086974855466&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5|None|Abstract. In this paper, we present an evaluation of four knowledge base systems (KBS) with respect to use in large OWL applications. To our knowledge, no experiment has been done with the scale of data used here. The smallest dataset used consists of 15 OWL files totaling

To turn this flexibility into a practical advantage, it is of high importance to have tools and methods, which offer similar flexibility in exploring

Widespread adoption of the semantic web depends critically on lowering the “barriers to entry” facing document producers. We describe a system that applies automatic partial parsing of web pages into the representations of the large ResearchCyc ontology,
